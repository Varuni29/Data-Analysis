# Data Exploration and Visualization of Covid-19 Data

## Description:
This repository showcases my data exploration and visualization skills through a portfolio project. The project involves analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL and creating visualizations in Tableau.

### SQL Data Exploration: 
The project includes a SQL script that demonstrates data exploration techniques. I utilized SQL queries to perform the following tasks:

- #### Data Cleansing: 
  Cleaned the COVID-19 dataset by handling missing values, data inconsistencies, and outliers.
- #### Data Aggregation: 
  Aggregated COVID-19 data to calculate key metrics such as total cases, deaths, and recovery rates.
- #### Time-Series Analysis: 
  Conducted time-based analysis to identify trends, patterns, and seasonality in the COVID-19 data.
- #### Geographic Analysis: 
  Utilized SQL functions to analyze the geographic spread of COVID-19 cases across different regions.
- #### Statistical Analysis: 
  Performed statistical calculations to derive meaningful insights from the data.

### Tableau Visualization:
Using Tableau, I transformed the analyzed COVID-19 data into compelling visualizations. The visualizations include:
- #### Interactive Dashboards: 
  Created interactive dashboards to present the key findings and allow users to explore the data in depth.
- #### Charts and Graphs: 
  Developed various charts and graphs such as line charts, bar charts, and area charts to visualize COVID-19 trends, comparisons, and correlations.
- #### Geospatial Maps:
  Designed maps with data overlays to illustrate the geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases and highlight hotspots.
- #### Predictive Analysis: 
  Utilized Tableau's predictive analytics capabilities to forecast future COVID-19 trends based on historical data. This includes techniques such as time-series forecasting   and predictive modeling.
